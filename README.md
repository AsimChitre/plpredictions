# plpredictions
A model to predict the results of the matches of Premier League 2019-20

We will be using Poisson Distribution in order to predict the results of the matches 

We have three files 

1. plpredictions.py - This contains the model for predicting 
2. pl_final.csv - This data was taken from http://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php 
3. notes.txt - This contains the index of the column headers from the csv file
